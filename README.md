Data analysis of coffee sales made via vending machine. (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ihelon/coffee-sales/data) 
My intention is to replicate a company's goal to maximize profits, and to future proof inventory. 

RMarkdown clearly shows each of the following steps taken:

- Cleaning of data
- Investigation of price changes over time, which is found to be normalized amongst the flavours
- Visulization of coffee flavour purchase distributions for each month
- Final visualization showing all the data as a singular, effective graph
- Recommendations

Attached to this repository is a very user friendly html file, designed for stakeholders who are unfamiliar with R. 

Continuing to update this analysis as more data is available.
