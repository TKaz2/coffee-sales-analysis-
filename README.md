To view the entirety of this project, please download and open the html file in this repository. I made an RMarkdown which is very user friendly and suitable for stakeholders who may not be familiar with R. 

Data analysis of coffee sales made via vending machine. (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ihelon/coffee-sales/data) 
My intention is to replicate a company's goal to maximize profits. 

RMarkdown clearly shows each of the following steps taken:

- Cleaning the data 
- Investigation of price changes over time, which is found to be normalized amongst the flavours
- Analyzing and visualizing the number of sales in relation to price changes, as well as revenue to determine the most profitable pricing
- Analyzing and visualizating the sales made for each specific coffee flavour, for each month
- Made recommendations 


Continuing to update this analysis as more data is available.
