Data analysis of coffee sales made via vending machine. (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ihelon/coffee-sales/data) 
My intention is to replicate a company's goal to maximize profits. 

RMarkdown clearly shows each of the following steps taken:

- Cleaning the data 
- Investigation of price changes over time, which is found to be normalized amongst the flavours
- Analyzing and visualizing the number of sales in relation to price changes, as well as revenue to determine the most optimal pricing
- Visulization of coffee flavour popularity for each month
- Made recommendations

Attached to this repository is a very user friendly html file, designed for stakeholders who are unfamiliar with R. 

Continuing to update this analysis as more data is available.
